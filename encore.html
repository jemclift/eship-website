                        The choreography was seriously next-level. The dancers hit every beat with precision, but it still felt natural and full of energy. Honestly, I only went to this show because my flatmate was in it, but I ended up being genuinely impressed. The transitions between numbers were slick, the pacing was tight, and the lighting gave it all a really polished feel. Plus, for a student production, the overall quality was way higher than I expected. Tickets were super affordable too, so definitely good value. Would absolutely recommend to anyone even remotely into musicals – it's the kind of show that wins you over whether you planned to enjoy it or not.

                        This show was pure serotonin from start to finish. It had that feel-good energy of a Glee episode, but with way more charm and way less cringe. The variety in the setlist was amazing — you never knew what was coming next, but each song brought something new and exciting. One minute I was laughing out loud during a reindeer duet, and the next I was genuinely emotional during a stripped-back Dear Evan Hansen solo. It’s rare to find a revue that balances comedy, heart, and musical talent so well, but this one nailed it. The cast brought so much personality to each number, it felt like a celebration of musical theatre in its purest form.

                        Every single soloist had serious pipes. I’m talking Broadway-caliber vocals that made the audience go silent mid-note. The Frozen 2 moment was an actual highlight – soaring vocals, gorgeous harmonies, and a sense of drama that gave me actual goosebumps. But honestly, it wasn’t just the big ballads – even the smaller ensemble numbers had these tight vocal layers that made everything sound rich and full. You could tell how much work went into it, and it paid off. Add that to the charisma on stage and clever staging, and you’ve got a show that punches well above its weight.

                        It felt like someone curated the ultimate musical theatre playlist and brought it to life with glitter, enthusiasm, and seriously tight harmonies. From High School Musical to Heathers to Frozen 2, every number had its own vibe but somehow still fit together like a big, joyful puzzle. There was a bit of chaos — costume changes flying, scene shifts on the fly — but it made the whole thing feel alive and spontaneous. The chemistry between the performers was off the charts, and you could tell everyone was having the time of their lives on stage. The audience was loving it too, clapping along, laughing, and even wiping away a few tears. Encore? Yes, please.

                The production quality of this student-led show was seriously impressive. The lighting and staging complemented the musical numbers so well, and some of the solo vocals were genuinely breathtaking. A few moments dragged slightly, but overall it was a highly enjoyable night of entertainment.

                While some of the middle numbers lost a bit of momentum, the finale brought everything together in a big, satisfying way. The cast’s passion really came through, and I loved the creative medleys they put together. You can tell a huge amount of work went into this.
